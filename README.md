## Directions 
- Building off of Lab 37, 
  - Add a Second resource into your application (i.e. We added lists)
  - Add the appropriate Controller and actions for your additional resource. 
  - Here is what your actions should contain:
    - Get(ALL) => Get all the lists possible
    - Get (ID) => Get the list AND it's associated IDs *See Note beneath directions*
    - POST => Create a new list
    - PUT => Update a List
    - Delete => Delete a list and all it's associated Tasks.
    
 - Write unit tests. Have a TOTAL (for your whole project) of 8 working/passing unit tests. 
-  COMMENT your code. Clearly. Identify the above requirements within your code. It is important that ALL The code written in this project is yours and you comment exaclty what/why everything is going on. 
- Use Postman to test your API.
- Deploy your application to Azure

**NOTE:** During our demo, I had put our Get tasks call in our model. I have updated the demo code accordingly, we will keep the database call in our Controller for this lab. it is possible to have this call in our model, except it takes a littel bit more *advanced* work then what we have covered so far this week. Keep database ("_context") calls to the controller.
